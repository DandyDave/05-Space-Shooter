I made a an astroids like space shooter for my Game Technology class at Indiana Univversity. There are many parts of the code that were built out python arcade demonstrations. I still need to figure out how to get the bullets to spawn out the end of the sprite and not the ccenter. 

If you want to change the "difficulty"
Changes self.lives in line 125 and 149 will add more player lives/health
And changing STARTING_ASTEROID_COUNT in line 22 willl change the amount of starting asteroids.
